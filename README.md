# Flappy Bird

This project is a re-imagining of a Flappy Bird clone I originally developed and lost. After losing the first version, I decided to rebuild it from scratch, adding improvements along the way, while staying true to the simplicity and fun of the original game.

Built using **Unity** and **C#**, this version introduces enhanced mechanics and new features that weren't present in the initial build.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smooth Gameplay**: Tweaked physics and control mechanics for a more polished and responsive experience.
- **Improved Visuals**: Revamped bird animations and backgrounds, with better use of Unity's rendering.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: As the player progresses, the difficulty ramps up with faster pipes and smaller gaps.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Objective**: Control the bird and navigate through obstacles (pipes) without crashing.
- **Controls**: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings.
- **Scoring**: You score a point for every set of pipes you pass through.
- **End of Game**: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

## 🌟 What's New in This Version?

- **Unity Engine**: The game has been redeveloped using Unity for better performance and cross-platform compatibility.
- **Enhanced Collision System**: More accurate hit detection for a fairer challenge.
- **Customizable Settings**: Add future customization options, including changing skins, music, or background scenes.

## 📋 To-Do List

- **Mobile Adaptation**: Add touch controls and optimize for mobile platforms (Android/iOS).
- **Power-Ups**: Introduce random power-ups to spice up gameplay.
- **Global Leaderboard**: Implement an online leaderboard to track high scores globally.
